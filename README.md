## Primary Objective
Following a similar game style to Hangman, Word Flight has players race against the clock to build as many planes as possible within the time limit.

## How to Win
Players will not lose in this score-based game, but they will earn points for how many planes they build. The more planes the player builds within the time limit, the higher the score.

## Detailed Description
As the game begins, players will see an open hangar with tools and parts laying around the edges. Players build the planes by guessing all the letters in a word, randomly selected from a bank of words associated with local sponsors. Each letter guessed correctly will add a piece to the plane. Once a plane is finished, it rolls out the hangar to make room for the next construction, until the timer runs out. Upon completion, players may input their two-letter initials to record their score.

## Gameplay
- The game will populate blank spaces based on the number of letters in the word chosen from a word bank.
-	All 26 letters will be displayed on the screen for the player to select to make a guess.
  - After a letter is selected, it will be crossed or grayed out, preventing players from selecting it multiple times.
-	An incorrect guess will result in an “Incorrect” message, but nothing will happen to the plane.
-	A correct guess will result in a “Correct” message and a piece of the plane will be added to the construction.
-	A complete plane will display sponsor logos and roll out of the hangar to make room for the next plane.
-	The process will repeat until the timer runs out.

### Editable database for word bank
* Words will have relation to sponsors (i.e. products the sponsors sell)
